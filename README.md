# LinearRegression
Linear Regression Using Boston Housing Data Set


# Summary

The purpose of this project is to predict housing prices using features provided in the Boston Housing Data Set.

Linear regression is used to model and predict continuous outcomes with normal random errors. There are nearly an infinite number of different types of regression models and each regression model is typically defined by the distribution of the prediction errors (called "residuals") of the type of data. Logistic regression is used to model binary outcomes whereas Poisson regression is used to predict counts. In this exercise, we'll see some examples of linear regression as well as Train-test splits.

Some packages used are: statsmodels, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
